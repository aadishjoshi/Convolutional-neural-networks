# Convolutional-neural-networks
### CNN codes

These are the codes I wrote for the course of 'Special Topics in Computer Science - Convolutional Neural Networks' under Prof. Dr. Arthur Redfern at The University of Texas at Dallas.

#### Assignment 1
To implement a sample CNN Style 2D convolution using Python/ Java. My program is in Java.<br>
